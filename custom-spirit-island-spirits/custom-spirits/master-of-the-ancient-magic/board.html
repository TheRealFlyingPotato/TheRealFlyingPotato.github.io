        During Time Passes, forget all but 2 Ancient Magic cards.
      </special-rule>
      <special-rule>
        If a {fast} power is ever one of your Ancient Magic cards, replace it with the top power of the Minor power deck. <i>(This repeats as neccessary.)</i>
      </special-rule>
      <special-rule>
        You may play your Ancient Magic cards as though they were in your hand. Doing so costs 1 energy less and does not provide any elements. Powers played this way are not dicarded at end of turn and instead are kept in your Ancient Magics.
      </special-rule>
      <special-rules-subtitle>Offer Power to Other Spirits</special-rules-subtitle>
      <!-- <special-rule>When another {spirit} with {presence} in the same land as your {sacred-site} gains a Minor Power, they may instead <i>(with your permission)</i> gain one of your Ancient Magic cards. If they do, gain a Minor Power to your Ancient Magics. <i>When they do this they do not draw from the Minor Powers.</i></special-rule> -->
      <special-rule>Other spirits get {range-plus-1} when targeting from a land with your {sacred-site}.</special-rule>
      <special-rule>The second time another spirit targets a power from your {sacred-site} each round, you may reclaim a power card.</special-rule>
