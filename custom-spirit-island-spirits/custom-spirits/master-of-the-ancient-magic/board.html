      <special-rule>
        You may play your Ancient Magic cards as though they were in your hand. Doing so costs 1 energy less and does not provide any elements. Powers played this way are not dicarded at end of turn and instead are kept as your Ancient Magic cards.
      </special-rule>
      <special-rule>
        Whenever you have more than 2 Ancient Magic Power cards, forget one.
      </special-rule>
      <special-rule>
        If a {fast} power is ever one of your Ancient Magic cards, replace it with the top power of the Minor power deck. <i>(This repeats as neccessary.)</i>
      </special-rule>
      <special-rules-subtitle>Offer Guidance to Other Spirits</special-rules-subtitle>
      <special-rule>When another spirit gains a power, they may instead <i>(with your permission)</i> gain one of your Ancient Magic cards. If they do, gain a Minor Power to your Ancient Magic cards.</special-rule>
